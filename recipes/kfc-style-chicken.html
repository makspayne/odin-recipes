    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>KFC Original Recipe Chicken has been a huge part of my childhood. This food memory is one I can still enjoy
        anytime I wanted.</p>
    <p>So here we are all trying to decode the famous 11 herbs and spices. Everyone has theories, and according to KFC
        no one has EVER been right.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/3 tablespoon dried oregano leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon celery salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mustard</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons paprika (original recipe calls for 4 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ground white pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Accent Seasoning , optional (I left this out)</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 chicken , cut into 10 pieces (2 wings, 2 legs, 2 thighs and 2 breasts each cut in half to make 4 breast
            pieces)</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the spices to a small food processor until they're all uniform in size and the thyme, basil and oregano
            aren't
            larger in size anymore.</li>
        <li>Add the flour in a bowl with all the herbs and spices and mix with a whisk.</li>
        <li>In a second larger bowl add the buttermilk and egg together and whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the buttermilk mixture for 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the buttermilk soak and let any excess buttermilk drip off.</li>
        <li>Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour mixture on all sides, then shake off the excess coating.</li>
        <li>Let it rest on a cookie sheet for 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add oil to a deep fryer or a large pot that is at least 5 inches high so that the chicken can be fully
            submerged.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil to 350 degrees and fry in small batches for 15-18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oil and add to a drying rack on top of a clean cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>If you add it to a paper towel or newspaper the bottom of the chicken will steam from the heat and become
            soft.</li>
    </ol>
