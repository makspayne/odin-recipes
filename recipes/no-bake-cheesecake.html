    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There are certain days during the summer when the last place anyone wants to be is in a hot kitchen. But that's
        when
        kids can come to the rescue, making a delicious dessert for the whole family without ever having to ask their
        parents to
        turn on the oven. This <strong>no-bake cheesecake</strong> is sure to please with its creamy center.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 packages (20 sheets) graham crackers</li>
        <li>11 tablespoons (1 3/8 sticks) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 8-ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 14-ounce can (1 1/4 cups) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag, and crush them with a rolling pin until very fine
            crumbs form.</li>
        <li>Pour crumbs into a medium bowl; stir in sugar. Add butter, and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Press the crumb mixture into a 9-inch springform pan, spreading it 1 1/2 to 2 inches up the side; press
            flat. Chill
            crust in freezer at least 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the filling: Using an electric mixer set at medium-high speed, beat the cream cheese in a
            large bowl
            until smooth. Beat in the condensed milk a little at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl, as necessary.
            Beat in the
            lemon juice and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the crust; smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap, and
            refrigerate until
            firm, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Unclasp sides of pan, and remove cheesecake.</li>
    </ol>
